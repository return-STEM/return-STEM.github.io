I'm Jason, head of course development at Return STEM. I've been programming for several years now, mainly in Python.
I've helped to program several apps and won the NASA App Development Challenge. My hobbies include playing the piano. I
helped found this organization because I wanted to provide open access to good programming courses that include the
applications of programming.
