# Storing Information

* Information is all around you, represented in different ways:
  * Amount of apples in a basket: Number
  * What day of the week it is: Word
  * A series of words: Sentence
  * A series of sentences: Paragraph
* There are different ways to store information, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
* Computers do this too.
* In this lesson, you will learn how to store information, called  **variables.**


# Creating a Variable

Variables are one way Python stores information.

You can think of them as containers:
**ADD AN IMAGE HERE**

The variable x is storing the value 4. From the point when you assign 4 to x, the program will "see" 4 whenever x is used.

For example, you could use a variable to represent the number of days someone has attended school, a word or sentence, or whether someone has eaten breakfast.

# Variables In Python

* Variables are declared like this:
* First, the **name of the variable**  is written.
* Then, the **assignment operator** `=` is used, followed by what you want the variable to be.
* In python, the equals sign `=`  _does not mean_  "equal to". It means  _assignment_ .
* Instead of thinking it as "a equals 14", think of it as "a is now 14".
* Variables can take on various different data types:

```python
age = 14                 # This is an int

height = 5.7             # This is a float

name = "Joe"             # This is a string

happy = True             # This is a boolean
```
## Using Variables
After creating a variable, you can use that variable in your code. For example,

For example, if you write:

```python
my_variable = "hello world"
print(my_variable)
>>> hello world
```

The `print()` function is taking the data stored inside `my_variable`, which is the string `"hello world"` and outputting it to the console

# Variable Naming

* When naming a variable in Python, there are certain rules
  * The name must start with a letter or underscore (_)
	  * `height`
  * The name cannot start with a number
`3Times` is **not** allowed
`ThreeTimes` is allowed
  * The name must contain only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) or underscores
  * Variable names are case sensitive
`DAYS`, `Days`, and `days` are different variables
  * **Keywords** cannot be used as variable names

  > Tip: Use names that would make sense to you and anyone reading your program. For example, if you are working with a program with many numbers, use names that would help you identify the difference easily.

* There are many methods used to make your code more readable and understanding when working with variables.
* With variables with multiple words in the name, use **snake case**
  * **Snake case** has lowercase letters with underscores between each word
    * `number_of_days_fishing` and `years_passed` are snake case variable names
  * **Camel case**  is similar to snake case but doesn’t underscores. Instead, the you use a capital letter to indicate the start of a new word(the first letter however is lowercase
    * `thisIsCamelCase` is an example of camel case
* Variable names should be concise and explain what the purpose of the variable is
  * Ex: `rect_length` is a shorter and better way to name a variable that stores the length of a rectangle than `the_length_of_the_rectangle`

# Data Types
## What is a data type?

* **Data Types** are different ways to represent data[]().
* Each data type has its own properties and behaves differently
* Numeric Data Types (int, float):
  * Numeric data types represent numbers
    * Lets us do arithmetic with numbers
* Sequence Data Types:
  * Stores a  **collection**  of data 
    * Strings store a   **sequence** of individual characters (a word is a sequence of letters, and a sentence is a sequence of words)**
    * **Lets us organize data**

## Integers

Integers, or  **int**  for short, represent  _positive or negative whole numbers_.

Examples: -100, -10, 0, 60, 85, 4529

We can use integers to represent things like the number of wheels on a car, or students in a classroom, etc.

You can think of integers in Python just like integers in math. They behave similarly and are defined in the same way.

However, integers  _cannot_  store decimal points: Python will simply   **truncate**  (cut) the decimal away:  8.9 → 8

5.00 → 5

4.20 → 4

## Floats

* Floats are a different type of number
  * Stands for floating-point number
  * They can have decimal points, unlike integers.
  * Just like integers, they can be   signed   (positive or negative).
* Examples of Floats:
    * 9.0 
    * 5.55
    * 3.33333333
    * 5.9450
  * Floats can be used for things like temperature (84.6),   grade averages (95.5),   or any number that might not be in whole numbers.

## Strings

* A string is a sequence of characters
  * A **character** is a single number, letter, or symbol
    * `'f'`, `'y'`, `'7'`, `'?'`, `';'`   are all characters
* A string is made up of multiple characters
	  * `"hello"` is a string made up of the characters `'h'`, `'e'`, `'l'`, `'l'`, `'o'`
* All strings are surrounded by quotes `""`
* Strings can be used to represent abbreviations, words, sentences, anything that can be written as text

Examples:
```python
"NASA"
"manager"
"Learning the English language can seem overwhelming."
"df75ac75-abaf-433b-a72b-836f8d9afd84"
```

String concatenation is "adding" multiple strings together

For example, if you have two different strings, you can combine to create the sentence

If you want to print a string x times, you can "multiply" it by x. 
```python
x = "I had "
y = "pizza today."
print(x+y)

>>> I had pizza today.

x = "Python "

print(5*x)
>>> Python Python Python Python Python
```

## Booleans

* Booleans (`bool`) can either be `True` or `False`
* They can be used for things like:
  * Whether a student is in school or not
  * If there are more than 6 eggs in the carton
  * Whether the student is vegetarian or not
* If a question can be answered with yes/no, it can be answered with a boolean
* Booleans can be represented with numeric values, where any number other than 0 would return `True` and a 0 would return `False`
  * A 5 would return `True`
* An empty string (`""`) will return `False` when casted to boolean, any other string will return `True`

## `type()`

**To retrieve the data type of a variable, the type() function can be used:**

```python
a = 10
b = 2.5
c = "Hello World"
d = False

type(a)

>>> <class 'int'>

type(b)

>>> <class 'float'>

type(c)

>>> <class 'str'>

type(d)

>>> <class 'bool'>
```

## What data type would work best?
- The number of customers a shop serves each day
- The average amount of money spent by each customer in a certain shop
- Whether a student has turned in their homework or not
- The license plate of a car
- Your date of birth (Month DD, YYYY)
- A discount for a certain item (10% off, etc.)
- A Phone number (### - ### - ####)
- Pi, using π = 3.1415
- Whether someone is above the age of 18

## What is the data type?

- `"January"`
- `23`
- `5.0`
- `"Hello I am John"`
- `123453241.0`
- `5`
- `True`
- `"False"`
- `7`
- `"5.0"`
- `Fall

## Data Types Chart

| Data Type | Python<br />syntax | What is it? | Example |  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Integer | int | Positive or negative whole numbers | Number of wheels on a truck | 10 |
| Float | float | Positive or negative decimals | Body temperature | 97.951 |
| Boolean | bool | A condition; True or False | I have three dollars in my pocket | False |
| String | str | A collection of characters (numbers, symbols, letters, etc.) | What is my dog's name? | "Spot" |

# Casting

Notice that  `5`  and `"5"`  are considered differently to Python.

This is because one is an `int`, and the other a `string`.

Or, for example,  `5` and `5.0`  are considered differently, because one is an `int`, and other a `float`.

If I have a string `"5"`, I need to make it an `int` to add it.

Python has special functions to convert the types of these values.

By using `int()`, `float()`, `bool()`, or `str()`, we can change the type of a variable with casting

Casting has certain features, outlined in this table:

| Function | Result | Behavior with: |  |  |  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|  |  | int | float | bool | str |
| int() | int | Already an int | int(5.3) → 5 | int(True) → 1<br />int(False) → 0 | int("10") → 10 |
| float() | float | float(5) → 5.0 | Already a float<br /> | float(True) → 1.0<br />float(False) → 0.0 | float("3.5") → 3.5 |
| bool() | bool | bool(5) → True<br />bool(0) → False | bool(5.3)→ True<br />bool(0.0)→ False | Already a bool | bool("pie") → True<br />bool("") → false |
| str() | str | str(5) → "5" | str(5.3) → "5.3" | str(True) → "True"<br />str(False)→ "False" | Already a str |

```python
a = 10
b = 2.5
c = "Hello World"
d = False
e = 0
f = "5"

print(bool(e))
>>> False
print(bool(a))
>>> True
print(int(b))
>>> 2

print(f + a)
>>> TypeError

print(int(f) + a)
>>> 15
```
