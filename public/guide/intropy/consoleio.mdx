# The Console

A location where the user can input commands (by typing into it) and view outputs

![](consoleio/consoleio1.png)

# Console Output

* The process of outputting something to the console
  * Done using the print() function in Python
    * When you use print(), it writes text on the console for the user to see.
    * You can also use variables with print().

```python
print("Hello World")

>>> Hello World
```

```python
x = "Hello"
print(x)
>>> Hello

#  Here, we use 9 and 10, which are integers
print(9 + 10)                        
>>> 19


# Here, we use "9" and "10", which are strings 
print("9" + "10")
>>> 910
```
## Using `print()`

The `print()` function accepts a  _string_  (a data type you learned in the last lesson).

Strings are a data type that can be used to represent sentences or words and are surrounded with "".

Basically, you can put whatever you want to print inside of the `""` to make it a string, then put that inside `print()` to print whatever you want.
```python
name = "Jack" 
print("My name is", name)
>>> My name is Jack

print("Hello World") 
>>> Hello World

print(Hello World) 
>>> Error
```

Here, notice that this line causes an error. You can try it out yourself - think about why it doesn’t work.

## Triple Quotes

Triple quotes can be used to easily represent strings over multiple lines;Notice that for triple quotes, you don't need to use \n for new lines.

Normally, when using triple quotes, you use three double quotes rather than single quotes.

To ignore the automatic new line, you can use the `\` character:

```python
long_str = """This is a string with triple quotes. As you can see, even though there are no newline characters,

It still displays newlines.

You can \

ignore new lines with the \\ character. """

print(long_str)

>>> This is a string with triple quotes.
As you can see, even though there are no newline characters,
It still displays newlines.
You can ignore newlines with the \ character.
```

## Long Comments (Using Triple Quotes)

Triple quoted strings, when used on their own, can act as multi-line comments:
```python
""" When this literal is by itself, it is also ignored by python.

This can be used to create multi-line comments.

You can use these comments to include information on

Your name, the purpose of the program, the prompt of the program if it was given, or how    to use the program. """
```

Even though you could use # over multiple lines, this way of commenting is more aesthetically appealing.

## It’s your turn

Using repl.it, write a short program that tells the user your name, and one fact about yourself using the print() function.

For example, your program might display:

```
My name is Jason and my favorite color is orange.
```

# Console Input
* The process of the user inputting something into the console
  * Done using the input() function in Python
    * The user is prompted in the console to give it input via their keyboard, and can submit their input using the ENTER key.
   
```python
x = input()
print(x)

>>> yo <- (my input)
>>> yo

x = input("What is your name? ")
print(x)

>>> What is your name? Joe <- (my input)
>>> Joe

text = "What is your name "
x = input(text)
print(x)

>>> What is your name Joe <- (my input)
>>> Joe
```

```python
# Nothing gets outputted because there is no print function
x = input()
>>> Hello <- (my input)

# Nothing can be done with this input because it is not assigned to a  variable 
input()
>>> Hello <- (my input)
```

## Using `input()`

Basically, `input()` looks like this:

This causes the program to ask for the user’s input, and then store it in the variable `my_var`.

Just like print, if you add a string inside of `input()`, it will print it out.

You can use this feature to ask questions inside input:
```
my_var = input()
x = input()
print(x)
>>> yo <- (my input)
>>> yo
```
```
x = input("What is your name?")
print(x)

>>> What is your name? Joe <- (my input)
>>> Joe

text = "What is your name"

x = input(text)
print(x)

>>> What is your name? Joe <- (my input)
>>> Joe
```

Using `input()` will always store a string into the variable

If you want to input a different data type, you need to cast it

For example, if you want to store someone’s age as an integer:

```python
age = int(input())
```

If you want to store a percent, you can cast the input as a float

```python
percent_positive = float(input())
```

# String Manipulation

Variables can also be used in string manipulation, and you can assign them to variables as well:

Finally, you can also use the `*` (multiply) symbol on strings to repeat them multiple times:

```
first_word = "Hello " 
second_word = "World"

third_word = first_word + second_word 
print(third_word) 
>>> Hello World
```

```
repeated = "hello" * 5

print(repeated) 
>>> hellohellohellohellohello
```

**Challenge: Print hello five times on the same line with spaces in between**
```
hello hello hello hello hello
```

* Sometimes, we need to add strings together to make them more useful.
* You can use + to  __concatenate__ (add) strings together:
  * Will join them end-to-end
* When you use + on both strings and numbers, python gets confused, because you can't add or concatenate either to the other.
* You can cast non-strings to strings using str()

```
print("cater" + "pillar")
>>> caterpillar

print("I am" + 7 + 8)
>>> TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

print(7 + 8 + " I am")
>>> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

# Indices and Strings

* Strings are sequences of characters (single numbers, letters, symbols).
  * Each character has its own index number, which tells us the character's position
```

"Hello sky!"
 ^^^^^^^^^^
 ||||||||||
 0123456789
```
  * The first character has an index of 0, the next one is 1, then 2, etc.
* You can access a single characters from a string by selecting its index
  * `string[index_number]`
```
my_string = "Hello sky!"

print(my_string[6])

print(my_string[4])

>>> s

>>> o
```

* You can also access multiple characters from a string, or create a  __substring__ , which is a slice, or part of a string
  * `string[start(inclusive):end(exclusive)]`
  * If a start value is not specified, it starts at index `0`
  * If an end value is not specified, it goes to the end of the string

```
my_string = "Hello World"

print(my_string[1:7])

>>> ello W

print(my_string[3:])

>>> lo World

print(my_string[:8])

>>> Hello Wo
```

## It’s your turn

Using repl.it, write a short program that asks for:
- The user’s name
- Their favorite color
- - What grade they are in

Then, the program prints this out:

```
Whatis your name? Jason
What is your favorite color? Orange
What grade are you in? 11th
Jason is in 11th grade and their favorite color is Orange.
```

# String Formatting
## f-strings

In the prompt before, you’ll notice that it was a lot of work to format the strings to print out variables.Thankfully, you can use f-strings:

f-strings are declared just like normal strings, but have an f in front. When you want to use a variable, use the `{}` symbols, called curly braces, and put the variable name inside.
```
name = "Joe"

print("His name is " + name) # No f-string
>>> His name is Joe

print("His name is", name) # No f-string
>>> His name is Joe

print(f"His name is {name}") # Using f-string
>>> His name is Joe
```

```
num1 = 10
num2 = 6

num1_string = "10"
num2_string = "6"

print(f"The sum is {num1 + num2}")
>>> The sum is 16

print(f"The sum is {num1_string + num2_string}")
>>> The sum is 106

print(f"The sum is {int(num1_string) + int(num2_string)}")
>>> The sum is 16
```


## `.format()`

On the previous slide, you used f-strings to fill variables into the curly braces.

Here, you will use the `.format()` method to a similar effect.

strings with `.format()` have `{}` placed in the same locations as they would be in an f-string. However, these do not need to be filled. If filled, they must be filled with previously undeclared variables, and those variables can be defined inside the parentheses of the format method.

```
name = "Joe"

print(f"His name is {name}") # Using f-string
>>> His name is Joe

print("His name is {}".format(name) # Using .format()
>>> His name is Joe

print("His name is {putName}".format(putName=name) # Using .format() with variable names
>>> His name is Joe
```

## `%s`

On the previous slide, you used `.format()` to fill variables into curly braces.

Here, you will use `%s` to fill variables into a string.

The syntax of `%s` is similar to `.format()`

When you put multiple `%s`, you can fill multiple variables into a string.

```
name = "Joe"

print("His name is {}".format(name)) <- Using .format()
>>> His name is Joe

print("His name is %s" % name) <- Using %s
>>> His name is Joe
```

# Escape Characters
## How do I get `'` in my string?

You might have noticed that when we use print() to display something, we always tell you to use quotes.

How do you get the `'` in the string?
Notice this:

![](consoleio/consoleio4.png)

If you were originally using single quotes at the start and end, you should switch to double quotes to avoid this issue.

If you plan to use both single and double quotes inside your string, you can use something called an  __escape character__ . In Python, the `\` (backslash) character signals to the computer that the next character is a character, and not related to the syntax.

There are also other escape characters using the `\` key:

| \n | Starts a new line | print("Hello\nWorld")<br /><br />> Hello<br />> World |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| \b | Backspace | print("Hello \bWorld")<br /><br />> HelloWorld |
| \t | Works like a tab | print("Hello\tWorld")<br /><br />> Hello    World |
| \\ | Acts as a regular backslash | print("Ok\\")<br /><br />> Ok\ |
| \' | Acts as a regular single quote (apostrophe) | print('Rob\'s World')<br /><br />> Rob’s World |
| \" | Acts as a regular double quote | print("He said \"try to\"")<br /><br />> He said "try to" |


# Methods
* The print() and input() functions we've gone over are called  __builtin__  functions
  * They are called (told to run) in this format: print(args)
    * args mean  __function arguments__ , things you put inside the parenthesis
* However, there are other functions, called methods, that are  __directly applied__  to what we call them from
  * We call them with a trailing period and the function name, then parenthesis
    * x.lower()

## String Methods

* Strings have many methods that can be called to manipulate (change) them
  * Example: x.lower() returns a lowercase version of the string stored inside x
* Most string methods will return a  __copy__  of the string, so make sure to assign the result to another variable
```
x = "My sTrIng"

y = x.lower()

print(x)

>>> My sTrIng

print(y)

>>> my string

a = "capslock"

a = a.upper()

print(a)

>>> CAPSLOCK
```


Method | Description | Example
----| ----|----
| .upper()<br />.lower() | Converts a string to uppercase or lowercase | x = "Hello World"<br />print(x.upper())<br />print(x.lower())<br /><br />>>> HELLO WORLD<br />>>> hello world |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| .replace(original phrase, new phrase) | Replaces the original phrase in a string with a new phrase | x = "Hello World"<br />print(x.replace("World", "People"))<br /><br />>>> Hello People |
| .capitalize() | Capitalizes the first letter of the string | x = "hello, friend."<br />print(x.capitalize())<br /><br />>>> Hello, friend. |
| .isdigit() | Returns a boolean that signifies whether all characters in the string are digits (0 to 9) | x = "1000"<br />print(x.isdigit())<br /><br />>>> True |
| .startswith(other: str)<br />.endswith(other: str) | Returns a boolean that signifies whether the string starts/ends with other | x = "The brown fox"<br />print(x.startswith("Th")<br /><br />>>> True |
| .count(other: str) | Returns the amount of times other appears in the string | x = "an armadillo jumped on an ice cube"<br /><br />print(x.count("an"))<br /><br />>>> 2 |
| len(string)<br />Note: This is a conventional function, not a method | Returns the length, or the total number of characters, of a string | x = "returnSTEM;"<br /><br />print(len(x))<br /><br />>>> 11 |
