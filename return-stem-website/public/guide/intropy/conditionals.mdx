# The Problem

* Write a program that, given a fahrenheit temperature reading from a thermometer, tells the user whether the patient has a healthy body temperature or not.
  * (Assume that a temperature over or equal to 100℉ indicates a fever)
* You already know how to:
* Take an input from the user and assign it to a variable
* Print out information for the user to see through the consoleHow can you make the program change what it does, based off of what the user types in?
* One way is to use  __if/else statements__ .

# Syntax

To solve our problem, we have decided to use  __if/else statements__ . But how exactly do these  __if/else statements__  work?

if x:

do A

else:

do B

Is the condition…

# If/Else structure

Execute the indented code

Is there an else if or else statement after this?

Skip all else if/else statements, go to rest of program

Go to the rest of the program

Go to the next one

# Syntax

The if statement is structured like this:

if (condition):   do this

When the condition is True, the statements under the indent are executed.

If it is False, the statements under the indent are ignored.

num = int(input())if num > 10:    print(“Greater than 10”)

The condition does not need to be surrounded in parenthesis, but it can be

# Indents in Python

When writing programs in Python, you’ll notice that some lines of code are  _indented_ .

if (condition):

do this # Indented

Indented lines are used to tell python which lines are part of the if statement and should be executed, like this:

condition = True

if (condition):    print(“Part of the if statement”)    print(“Also part of the if statement”)

a = 3 + 5 * 4 # Also part of the if statement

print(“This is outside the indent, so it is not part of the if statement.”)

# Statements after the indent are always executed.

# Comparison Operators

You learned that = is the assignment operator, and does not mean  _equal to_ .

In Python, == is the equivalence operator:5 == 5 is True

5 == 2 is False

For not equals, we use != 5 != 5 is False

5 != 2 is True

Greater than and Less than operators also work just like in math:	5 < 8 is True    5 > 2 is True

Finally, Greater than or equal to and less than or equal to use >= and <=:   	 5 <= 5 is True   	 5 <= 8 is True

For the table, a is 10 and b is 20

| Symbol | Operator | Definition | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| ==  | Equal To  | If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true. | (a == b) is not true. |
| !=  | Not Equal To | If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true. | (a != b) is true. |
| > | Greater Than | If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a > b) is not true. |
| < | Less Than | If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a < b) is true. |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal To | If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a >= b) is not true. |
| <= | Less Than or Equal To | If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a <= b) is true. |

# Let’s Practice

Evaluate each of the python expressions:

5 == "5"

3 != 5 - 2

5.0 == 5

True == "True"

False == "False"

5 > 3

8 <= 8

# Solving the problem

Write a program that, given a fahrenheit temperature reading from a thermometer, tells the user whether the patient has a healthy body temperature or not.

Let's solve this problem step by step:

We can see that we need user input, so we need to first store an input inside of a variable, then cast it into a float.

body_temp = float(input())

* Next, we need to check if the number is greater than 100. We can use an if statement for this:
* How can we modify the code so that it prints Healthy if the body temperature is not greater than 100?

body_temp = float(input())if body_temp > 100:    print(“Not Healthy”)

# Logical Operators

Operators that deal with boolean values are called  __logical operators__

There are three basic logical operators

| Operator | Definition | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| and | If both the operands are true then condition becomes true. | True and True → True |
| or | If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true. | True or False → True |
| not | Used to reverse the logical state of its operand. | not (True or False) → False |

* Logical operators also have an order of precedence
  * Parenthesis > not > and > or

# The and Operator

The “and” operator can return either True or False

You can think of it this way:Say I want you to give me an apple and a banana.I would not be satisfied with just an apple and no banana (False),and I would not be satisfied with just a banana and no apple (False).I would also not be satisfied with neither (False).You need to give me  _both_  conditions, for me to be satisfied (True).

For example:

a = 4

b = 5

(a == 4) and (b == 5)>>> True

(a == 3) and (b == 5)>>> False

(a == 4) and (b == 4)>>> False

# The or Operator

“Or” is just like and:If I wanted an apple  _or_  a banana, I would be fine with you giving me either, or both:	no apple, no banana →  False

no apple, banana → Trueapple, no banana →  True

apple, banana →  True

a = 4

b = 5

(a == 4) or (b == 5)> True

(a == 3) or (b == 5)> True

(a == 3) or (b == 4)> False

# The not Operator

* The "not" reverses the value
  * not True → False
  * not False → True

a = 4

b = 5

not((a == 4) or (b == 5))> False

(a == 4) and (not(b == 6))> True

# Conditionals with Strings

We can use both numbers and strings in our conditionals.When two strings are  _exactly the same_ , they are considered equal (==) by python.

For example:

a = “hello world”

b = “HELLO WORLD”

print(a == b)

> False

print(a == “hello world”)> True

print(a != b)> True

# Let’s Practice

_Evaluate if the expression is True or False:_

__Reminder: The order of precedence is parenthesis > not > and > or__

True and True or False

(5 != 0) or (0 != 0)

not(27/3 + 3 == 3*2*4/2)

False or False and True

not(25/(13+12) != 1) and True

# Try it yourself

Write a program which asks the user two integers: the length and width of a rectangle. The program then tells the user whether the rectangle is a square or not.

Example output:

length: 10

width: 20>>> Not a square

length: 25

width: 25

>>> Square

length: 0

width: -10

>>> Not a square

# Else and Else If Statements

Elif: “if the previous conditions were false, try this condition:”

Else if statements come after if statements and use the elif keyword

if (A):    # Do this if A is True

elif (B):

# Do this if A is False, but B is True

elif (C):    # Do this if A and B is False, but C is True

or, you can use an else statement for anything that does not satisfy all preceding conditions.

if (A):    # Do this if A is True

elif (B):    # Do this if A is False, but B is True

else:    # Do this if everything else is False

# Try it yourself

Write a program that accepts passwords from the user, and tells the user whether the password matches with the one stored inside.

Ex. if my password is the string "EggsAndSpam123":

__Important: __ Don't put any of your actual passwords, repl projects are public!

Enter a password: Hello World >>> Not correct

Enter a password: SpamAndEggs

>>> Not correct

Enter a password: eggsandspam123

>>> Not correct

Enter a password: EggsAndSpam123

>>> Correct

# Nested if

You can write if statements inside of other if statements.

This is called a nested if

if (a):

# a is True

if (b):		# b is True	else:		# b is False

else:	# a is False

* First, the program checks for the condition in the outside if.
* if a is True, it will execute the code inside the if
  * This causes it to look inside the inner if
* if a is False, it will skip the inside and never check if b is True

if (a):

# a is True

if (b):		# b is True	else:		# b is False

else:	# a is False

# Try it yourself

Write a program to test if a given year is a leap year or not.

A leap year is defined under the following conditions:

The year is divisible by 4

However, if the year is a century year (1800, 1900, 2000), it must be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year(Hint: You can use % to check whether a number is divisible by another)

Enter a year: 1900

>>> Not a leap year

Enter a year: 2000 >>> Leap year

Enter a year: 2016

>>> Leap year

Enter a year: 2021

>>> Not a leap year

# What can we make?

Now that you’ve learned conditionals, you can do many more useful things with programming. One of them could be a simple 4 function calculator.

You can look at the repl.it here: _[https://replit.com/@liuj05/5-Conditionals-Programming](https://replit.com/@liuj05/5-Conditionals-Programming)_

as an example.

Using the code provided in this repl, make modifications to it:1) Add the modulus function to this calculator

2) Add the power function (exponent) to this calculator

3) Change it so that it can accept floats as its input
